You can edit the `.git/hooks/post-commit` file to execute `git show --format=email HEAD | ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --codespell`.

Events are listed in `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events`. To enable, `cd` into the relevant event directory (e.g., `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/skb`) and `echo 1 > enable`.

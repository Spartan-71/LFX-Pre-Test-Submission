# Pre-test-4

## Task
Explain your choice of test subjects and how you plan to get the source questions and answers (must be copyright compliant)

## Solution
### 1] Choice of test subjects

I explored the Linux Foundation’s course catalog, which includes certifications, instructor-led courses, and SkillCred programs. From these, I chose the following areas based on my interests:

* **AI & ML** ([Link](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog/?_sft_topic_area=ai-machine-learning))
* **Linux Kernel Development** ([Link](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog/?_sft_topic_area=linux-kernel-development))
* **Open-Source Best Practices** ([Link](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog/?_sft_topic_area=open-source-best-practice))

Recently, I completed a beginner-level course in Linux Kernel Development ([LFD 103](https://www.credly.com/badges/18e7fa37-dda3-4ae9-8688-ce53d42dce09/public_url)) through the Linux Foundation that taught me How can I actually contribute to the linux kernel. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, which sparked my interest in exploring kernel development more deeply. Additionally, AI/ML remains my primary area of focus, and I’m always eager to expand my knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. As part of my open-source journey, I’ve also learned several industry best practices and would love to continue learning more.


### 2] How to source questions and answers?

For free courses that align with my areas of interest, I plan to enroll to access official questions, answers, labs, and quizzes. I will then manually curate a dataset from these resources, ensuring compliance with the terms of use.

For some well-known certifications like LFCS, LFCE, and CKA, I conducted a thorough search for openly available and legally shareable study materials or Q&A sets. However, I was unable to find any publicly accessible datasets that are copyright-compliant. If needed, I will reach out to content providers for permission.
